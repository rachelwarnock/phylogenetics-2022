## Questions on (Paul Lewis phyloseminar) part 1 (rename)

> something about unconstrained trees?

> How would you describe the terms **conditional probability** and **likelihood** in your own words?

> Why do we calculate likelihoods on a log scale?

> Why do we need to take into account the frequency at which we observe each character state? e.g. the frequency of A, T, G, or C in the case of DNA data.
Use the [Transition probability tool](https://plewis.github.io/applets/jc-transition-probabilities/) to explore this further. 

> Can you describe the gist of the pruning algorithm?

(I need to revise these too!)
(things I need to describe in week 2 -)
(the concept of having to calculate the probability of the observed data)
(state frequencies)
(substitution models, JC)
(expected substitutions per site, equilibrium frequencies)
(the molecular clock?)
(expected subs. per site)
(ATGC are different, codons)

## Notes
- we won't really encountered multifurcating or unresolved trees in this course. This is because... they're not output by any programs really
- summary trees (splits)
- newick strings
- pruning algorithm:  https://lukejharmon.github.io/pcm/chapter8_fitdiscrete/
