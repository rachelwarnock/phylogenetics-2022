# Course description

This hands on course focuses on the use of **Bayesian phylogenetics** in paleobiology. 
You will learn about approaches used to infer trees, divergence times, and evolutionary rates.

The course will take place in the summer semester **Tuesdays 14:00-16:00 CET**  in person at Henke Str.

The first part of the course will feature a mix of lectures and tutorials.
The course will focus on getting to grips with the software [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io). By the end of the course you should understand the principles of Bayesian phylogenetic inference and be able to apply this knowledge to a research question of your choosing.
You will also learn how to apply phylogenetic comparative methods using R.

During the second part of the course each participant will work on a project of their choice.

Course instructors: **Rachel Warnock**, **Emma Dunne**, and **Laura Mulvey**.

# Course evaluation

At the end of the course you should produce a short report based on your research findings. 
You will be provided with clear guidelines. 
The deadline for the report is **Friday 26th of July**.

Note: "Phylogenetics" is graded together with "Introduction to Statistical Modelling". Course code: RL-V3 MPP.
