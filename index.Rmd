# Course description

This hands on course focuses on the use of **Bayesian phylogenetics** in paleobiology. 
You will learn about approaches used to infer trees, divergence times and evolutionary rates. 

The course will take place in the summer semester **Tuesdays 14:00-16:00 CET**  in person at Henke Str.

The first half of the course will feature a mix of lectures and tutorial material.
Aside from week one, the course will focus on getting to grips with the software [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io). By the end of the course students should understand the principles of Bayesian phylogenetic inference and be able to apply this knowledge to a research question of their choosing.
During the second half of the course each participant will work on a project topic of their choice.

Course instructures: **Rachel Warnock**, **Tim Brandler** and **Laura Mulvey**.

Before the start of the course we recommend reading the following posts:

* [Tree Thinking Challenge](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1117727)
* [If we evolved from apes, why are there still apes?](https://blogs.iu.edu/sciu/2017/09/26/why-are-there-still-apes/) 

\

# Course evaluation

At the end of the course you should produce a short report based on your research findings. 
We will provide you with a template and guidelines. 
The deadline for the report is **Friday 28th of July**.

Note: "Phylogenetics" is graded together with "Introduction to Statistical Modelling". Course code: RL-V3 MPP.
