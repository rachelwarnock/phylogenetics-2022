# Course description

This hands on course focuses on the use of **Bayesian phylogenetics** in paleobiology. 
You will learn about approaches used to infer trees, divergence times, and evolutionary rates.

The course is taught in two parts. [Part 1](schedule_part_1.html) will take place as a 3 day block course, Mon 14.04.25 - Wed 16.04.25 in the Henke Str seminar room.
Part 2 will take place in the summer semester **Tuesdays 14:00-16:00 CET** in the same room.

The course will feature a mix of lectures and tutorials, so you will need to bring your laptop.
The course will focus on getting to grips with the software [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io). By the end of the course you should understand the principles of Bayesian phylogenetic inference and be able to apply this knowledge to a research question of your choosing.
You will also learn how to apply phylogenetic comparative methods using R.

During the final part of the course each participant will work on a project of their choice.

Course instructors: **Rachel Warnock**, **Emma Dunne**, **Laura Mulvey**, **Katie Cryer** and **Meghan Gallaspy**.

# Course evaluation

At the end of the course you should produce a short report based on your research findings. 
You will be provided with clear guidelines. 
The deadline for the report is **Friday 26th of July**.

Note: "Phylogenetics" is graded together with "Introduction to Statistical Modelling". Course code: RL-V3 MPP.
