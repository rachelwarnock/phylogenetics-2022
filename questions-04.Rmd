The content of this talk is fairly advanced but some of it will come in handy for subsequent parts of the course.

> 1. How are steps chosen in an MCMC analysis?

> 2. Give an example of a parameter you would estimate under each of the following prior distributions and try to state why?
  a. Gamma distribution
  b. Lognormal distribution
  c. Beta distribution
  d. Dirichlet distribution

> 3. Why do we sometimes need to calculate the marginal likelihood?

> 4. What is the difference between a hierarchical model and a non-hierarchical model?

> 5. Briefly explain how stepping stones can be used to calculate the marginal likelihood (advanced).

## Notes

*Congratulations you've reached the end of some pretty advanced talks! Don't worry if you didn't understand everything, we'll go over everything together in class!*
