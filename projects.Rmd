# Assessment

* Written report 
* 5 pages max, inc. references and figures
* Focus mainly on the methods and results 
* Brief intro & discussion (paragraph each)
* Final deadline 31.07.25
* Don't forget to provide access to the project code!


# Some guiding questions for your report

* What is the main question / hypothesis that you aim to address in your project?
* Describe the data, your model, and all your parameter choices
* Could someone else repeat your analysis based on the info you provide?
* If applicable, how did you assess MCMC convergence?
* Did you encounter any issues?
* How do your results differ to previously published results?

# Data sources

* [Graeme Lloydâ€™s database](http://www.graemetlloyd.com/matr.html) of character matrices
* Age info for many of these matrices can be found in [this paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsbl.2018.0263)


#### Some notes on nexus files

* Brackets
  * `(01)` would mean a given taxon has been observed with both states 0 and 1
  * `{01}` would mean a given taxon has been observed with state 0 *or* 1
  * I *think* RevBayes will ignore any characters in brackets...
