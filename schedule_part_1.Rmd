# Part 1

The first part of this course is a 3 day block course.
The aim is to introduce you to the major approaches used to reconstruct trees in paleobiology. By the end of the block course you should be able to reconstruct undated and dated trees using a Bayesian phylogenetic approach.

# Rough Schedule

* Mon 14 - 12:15-17:00 (parsimony, likelihood, and substitution models)
* Tue 15 - 11:00-17:00 (Bayesian inference, MCMC, clock models, node dating)
* Wed 16 - 11:00-17:00 (the fossilised birth-death process)

The course will take place in the Henke Str. Pal seminar room. **You will need to bring your own laptop.**
Before course begins, make sure you have have [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) installed.

**Reading**

* Re-familiarise yourself with [how to read a phylogenetic tree](https://artic.network/how-to-read-a-tree.html) and [rooting](https://slides.filogeneti.ca/include/rooting.html)
* Watch [A Brief History of Computational Phylogenetics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcD15i7yzJ8)

**Homework**

* Install the software [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io/download)
* Install the software [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) and [Tracer](https://github.com/beast-dev/tracer/releases/tag/v1.7.2)
* Windows users should also install [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org)
